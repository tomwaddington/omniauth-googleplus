`omniauth-gplus` is a Google+ strategy for OmniAuth.
It allows you to easily interact with the Google+ OAuth2 endpoint.


Examples
--------

To use `omniauth-gplus` in Rails you only need to put this in a initializer:

``` ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET']
end
```

By default the gem uses the `email` scope, but you can get more information with:

``` ruby
provider :gplus, ENV['GPLUS_KEY'], ENV['GPLUS_SECRET'], scope: 'email, profile'
```

The information schema looks like this:

``` ruby
info do
  {
    'email' => 'kurtisrainboltgreene@gmail.com',
    'name' => 'Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene',
    'first_name' => 'Kurtis',
    'last_name' => 'Rainbolt-Greene',
    'image' => 'http://somelongurl.png',
    'urls' => {
      "Google+" => 'http://urltouserprofile.com'
    }
  }
end

extra do
  {
    'locale' => 'en',
    'gender' => 'male',
    'birthday' => '2013-12-24',
    'raw_info' => # huge hash
  }
end
```
